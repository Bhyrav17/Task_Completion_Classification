<h3> Resource Allocation in a Company </h3>

<h2> 1.1 General Info </h2>
Human resource allocation is considered a relevant problem in business process management (BPM). The successful allocation of available resources for the execution of process activities can impact on process performance, reduce costs and obtain a better productivity of the resources.

>* Based on the above Picture, we observe that there is a lot of dimensonality invloved in allocation of resources in a company.
 
 
 
<h2> 1.2 What is the problem? </h2>
 
 There is a lot of technicalities involved in assigning an employee to a project/task. It is a tideous process to carefully assign the right employee to a desired task. There are many factors involved such as experience level, training levels, seniority etc in order for this allocation. 
 
The problem arises when the company has to decide which of its employee has to be allocated to which task. This labor intensive task was previously done and kept as records in Excel or some third party software. But with the inventio of ML, now the HR department can leverage this technology and predict if an employee will complete his/her task or not and accurately allocate the resources. 

<h2> 1.3 Interested Party and Reason </h2>

The HR department in a Multi National Company would be really interested in the explained ML model as it saves them time and cost for the company. It also cuts down manual labor which is invloved when collecting the data.


 Advantages of having a ML model with Task completion prediction powers:
  >- The HR department will have a pretty good idea who will complete their tasks or not.
  >- Based on the task completion or not, the HR dept can allocate resources to tasks.
  >- The model maybe used to evaluate an employee's performance like In how much time the employee completed his work? - This can be used to give promotions or additional payouts.
  >- Based on the results, the HR dept can train the employee's in certain level to achieve maximum efficiency ( More number of employees completing with a certain training level, then the rest of the employee's can be trained in the same level)
